# Applift code challenge

Build a RoR application to manage your media items collection.
 
It should be possible to create a user account, to sign in and out as a user, a user can manage and search his collection as well as to share it for others to see a visual representation of it.
 
A media item could either be a link to a video (i.e youtube), image(s), or a link to a website.
 
For testing I strongly recommend using rspec.
 
Bonus: Use TDD (should be visible in the git log)
 
The implementation should be DRY, restful and well-tested - please keep the code minimal and avoid from using scaffolds.
